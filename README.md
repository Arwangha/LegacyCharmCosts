# LegacyCharmCosts

A mod that reverts Quick slash and Flukenest to their older notch cost (2 notches).

# Settings:

Legacy Quick slash (default: on): if enabled, reverts quick slash cost to 2.

Legacy Flukenest (default: on): if enabled, reverts flukenest cost to 2.

Permanent changes (default: off): if enabled, the new costs will be saved to the save files used while the mod is enabled, allowing to keep the mod's effect without having the mod enabled. Otherwise, the current patch cost will be saved. Note that toggling this option takes effect instantly if a save is already loaded, or when the game loads a save otherwise.
