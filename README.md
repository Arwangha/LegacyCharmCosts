# Legacy Charm Costs

A mod that reverts Quick Slash and Flukenest to their older notch cost (2 notches).

# Settings:

Legacy Quick Slash (default: on): if enabled, reverts Quick Slash's cost to 2.

Legacy Flukenest (default: on): if enabled, reverts Flukenest's cost to 2.

Permanent changes (default: off): if enabled, the new costs will be saved to the save files used while the mod is enabled, allowing to keep the mod's effect without it being enabled. Otherwise, the current patch costs will be saved. Note that toggling this option takes effect instantly if a save is already loaded, or when the game loads a save otherwise.

# Note:

Make sure to unequip the charms before changing their costs, as the game doesn't check the amount of used notches when that happens.
